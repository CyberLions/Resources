# Past Competitions

Note: These are competitions the club (or club members) participated in. For a full list of the events that took place during a certain time period, see https://ctftime.org/ (a tracker of all CTF events) or this fairly complete organization detailing write-ups for competitions https://github.com/ctfs/.

* Work in progress: still getting together data on where our teams placed and who participated in different events. Expect these tables to be reworked quite a bit within the 2/3 weeks (hopefully)
